# Kaggle House Project

 Predicted house prices of the given dataset through Data Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms

 The project is carried out in Python
 Libraries used: numpy, pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib
 Machine Learning Algorithms used: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor

 The steps involved in the analysis and prediction are as follows:
- Importing the required libraries and the dataset
- Analyzed the distribution of Sales Prices
- Handling of columns with missing values by either dropping or filling it. 
- Used Correlation Matrix and Visualizations for Feature Extraction
- Split the data into Train and Test
- Standardized the Data
- Trained Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor to predict the prices on test data

 The Root Mean Squared error with both the models were almost same
 The Explained Variance with both the models was 87%
